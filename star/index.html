<p>A pentagram (sometimes known as a pentalpha, pentangle, or star pentagon) is a regular 
  five-pointed star polygon, formed from the diagonal line segments of a convex (or simple, or non-self-intersecting) 
  regular pentagon. Drawing a circle around the five points creates a similar symbol referred to as the pentacle,[1] 
  which is used widely by Wiccans and in paganism, or as a sign of life and connections. The word "pentagram" refers 
  only to the five-pointed star, not the surrounding circle of a pentacle.</p>

<p>Pentagrams were used symbolically in ancient Greece and Babylonia. Christians once commonly used the pentagram to 
  represent the five wounds of Jesus.</p>
  
<p>The word pentagram comes from the Greek word πεντάγραμμον (pentagrammon),[2] from πέντε (pente), "five" + γραμμή 
  (grammē), "line".[3] The word pentagram refers to just the star and the word pentacle refers to the star within a 
  circle, although there is some overlap in usage.[4] The word pentalpha is a 17th-century revival of a post-classical 
  Greek name of the shape.[5]</p>
