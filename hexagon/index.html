<p>The triangle is one of the earliest known geometric shapes, with evidence 
of its use dating back to ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq), over 5000 years ago. 
Its name was derived from the Latin word ”triangulus,” meaning “three-cornered”.</p1>

  Triangles can be used in art in many different ways. They can be used to make optical illusions, 
  to add details to many different things and can even be used to make things like teeth, spikes, swords, 
  or blades of grass. Triangles are used to bring harmony to the artists drawing, sketch or painting.
