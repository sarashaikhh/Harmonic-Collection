<p>Dating back to the Roman times of 36 B.C., philosophers wondered about the honeycomb 
  shape and it was not until many generations later that it was discovered and proven that 
  the honeycomb shape is the most mathematically perfect form, leaving very little waste 
  when the shape is lined together. For centuries, scientists were confused on why bees chose 
  the hexagon shape as opposed to shapes like a square or circle. The answer comes in the form 
  of packing efficiency.
